# CubesInSpace
This  demo allows the user to place cubes in space by tapping on screen. The cubes are physical bodies and respond to gravity is the value is changed from zero.

This project borrows heavily from the ARBrush for SCNVector 3 extensions and inital AR Setup. See that here: https://github.com/laanlabs/ARBrush

Changed to fit the purpose of including SceneKit Content
